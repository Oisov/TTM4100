Questions

The goal of this first lab was primarily to introduce you to Wireshark. The
following questions will demonstrate that youâ€™ve been able to get Wireshark up
and running, and have explored some of its capabilities. Answer the following
questions, based on your Wireshark experimentation:

1. List 3 different protocols that appear in the protocol column in the
   unfiltered packet-listing window in step 7 above.

MONS, TCP, DNS, HTTP

2. How long did it take from when the HTTP GET message was sent until the HTTP
   OK reply was received? (By default, the value of the Time column in the packet
   listing window is the amount of time, in seconds, since Wireshark tracing began.
   To display the Time field in time-of-day format, select the Wireshark View pull
   down menu, then select Time Display Format, then select Time-of-day.)

       Sent: 20:09 : 52 : 544465019
Recieved OK: 20:09 : 52 : 686407227

Time Difference: 0.141942208 seconds

3. What is the Internet address of the gaia.cs.umass.edu (also known as
   www.net.cs.umass.edu)? What is the Internet address of your computer?

gaia.cs.umass.edu: 128.119.245.12
         computer:  10.0.0.27

4. Take screenshots of the two HTTP messages (GET and OK) referred to in
   question 2 above. The screenshots should include the packet-header window for
   these messages and the packet list window (see the beginning of this tutorial
   for the descriptions of the different windows).
